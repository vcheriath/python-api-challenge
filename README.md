Homework - Module6 for Rutgers Data Science Bootcamp
- Vigneshwar Cheriath

This repo contains my homework for Module 6 - Python APIs

This repo contains two jupyter notebook files: WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb
NOTE: please run WEatherPY.ipynb first, as it generates city data used by VacationPy.ipynb

This repo contains an output folder with the images and city data generated.

All this work was done by myself alone
